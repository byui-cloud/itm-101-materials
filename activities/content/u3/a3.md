##### Application Project

For this project, with the help of ChatGPT, you will build a web app with **create-react-app**. You may need to use npx instead of npm. Create a simple todo web app that meets the following criteria. The app should use create-react-app, this is something you haven't learned so use ChatGPT to learn. The app should also allow users to create new todo items, delete items, complete items, and any other features you think a todo app should have. 

Once you've completed the activity, submit your work on Canvas.
